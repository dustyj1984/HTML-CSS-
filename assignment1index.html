    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>My life has not followed a typical trajectory looking like a bunch of scribbles on a piece compared to a nice straight line. Some state this is because of a lack of focus, but I push back on that notion.</p>

        <p><mark>Life is complex</mark>, and if one <b>really</b> wants to be successful, they must develop many skills with a bored knowledge base that enables them to understand how the world works. I would dare to say that the scribbles all over the paper display a <ins>greater</ins> focus than simply following a predetermined path.</p>

        <p>So, I can summarize my life biography<sup>TM</sup> with a simple I live by, <i>"I am not trying to be correct; I am just trying to get the correct answer."</i> <sub>Dustin Jensen</sub></p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
